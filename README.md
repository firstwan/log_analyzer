CFC Project - Log Analyzer
==============================
## Introduction
Machine logs contain multiple of valuable information on user activities, and machine service status. Some of the information might include the indicator of compromise. But these log files usually contain a lot of different event messages and they happen simultaneously and become hard to read for human eyes.

This project is to create a Python script to analyze log files and create a comprehensive output for different events. Events included new user creation, user running sudo command, user changing password, etc.
